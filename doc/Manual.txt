DOM (V0.0)	Manual
It is a very early version of DOM pipeline. So you have to be a perl programmer to use this pipeline. Now the pipeline is only suit for Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR10) genome. 

The pipeline includes several procedures:
1.BS-seq reads mapping
2.DMR (Differentially methulated regions) calling by mutilple control libraries
3.S-MOD (Statistical Mearsurement of Overlapping of DMRs)
4.Q-MOD (Quantitative Mearsurement of Overlapping of DMRs)

The following paragraphs describe how to use the pipeline:

1. BS-seq reads mapping (/1_BS-seq_mapping)
	This step processes raw fastq file from BS-seq. You have to install BSMAP firstly before run this step. 
	We have two scripts for mapping BS-seq reads using BSMAP:
		multiple_BSMAP.pl for single end libraries; multiple_BSMAP_PE.pl for pair end libraries. 
	The two scripts depend on the other three scripts:  methratio_alt.py, BSmap_to_cytosine.pl, Cytosine_to_100bp.pl; the two files also depend on two large file: TAIR10 genome, Cytosine files. So you have to check the route is right in above two scripts. 
	The step will generate 100bp files, seprated into CHH, CHG and CG files. You can use Parse_BSMAP_log_By100bp.pl to get the mapping statistcs result. 
		
2. DMR calling (/2_DMR_calling)
	multiple_DMR_WTvsMUTANT.pl  processes a folder containing 100bp files from above step. It depends on the R script. You can use DMR_Allchr_commnad_noFtest.R if you have a lot of libraries to run. 
	This step will generate files containing DMRs from comaprision with test libraries and multiple libraries. 
	
3. Mearsurement of Overlapping of DMRs (/DOM)
