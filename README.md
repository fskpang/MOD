# MOD

## What is MOD?

* MOD stands for Mearsurement of Overlapping of DMRs. It is a pipeline to compare DNA methylation profiles among mutiple Bisulfite-Seq libraries. For details, see Ref. [1].

* The pipline includes several procedures:
   * BS-seq read mapping
   * DMR (Differentially methulated regions) calling by mutilple control libraries
   * S-MOD (Statistical Mearsurement of Overlapping of DMRs)
   * Q-MOD (Quantitative Mearsurement of Overlapping of DMRs)
   
* It is a very early version, we are working on the improvement of computational efficiency and making it more user freindly. 

## Run MOD

* Please read the manual to study the examples. These examples should get you started.
